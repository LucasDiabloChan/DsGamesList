Hi everyone, greetings!

This project was developed during a course taught by Nelio Alves. 
In this project, we developed and learned many things, such as using the H2 DBMS (an in-memory database), working with the Postman application (to test APIs), and utilizing the Spring Tool Suite and related tools. Additionally, we learned effective methods for implementing various types of logic and business rules.

This course was offered from January 20, 2025, to January 26, 2025.
