Hi everyone, greet meetings!

This project was developed during a course, teached by Nelio Alves.
In this project, we develop and learned many things, like the H2 DBMS (in memmory database), use the PostMan Application (to testing APIs), use the Spring Tool Suit and relateds. Also we learned good ways to implement some kind of logics and business rules.  

This course were offered from 20/01/2025 to 26/01/2025.
